                spreading the glory of spork.</p></li>
                <li><p>- I'm giving this guy some credit just for not stealing graphics from my site. The fact that he has no graphics.. or links.. or much of anything is moot really.</p></li>
                <li><p>- ``The <em>Other</em> Spork Page''??? Who does this guy think he is? (man, having an ego rules)</p></li>
                <li><p>- This guy thinks he's cool because he has ``spork.com''. And if it weren't for that I'd never have found him. </p></li>
                <li><p>- Okay, so it has nothing to do with sporks. but dammit, If I don't get Cool Site...</p></li>
