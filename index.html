                <h4>Spork:</h4>
                <p>Blend of sp(oon sb. + f)ork sb. A proprietary name for a piece of cutlery combining the features of a spoon, fork, (and sometimes, knife).`Spork' is the colloquial term for `Runcible Spoon'.</p>
                
                <h4>Patent Information:</h4>
                <p>1970 Official Gaz. (U.S. Patent Office) 11 Aug. tm 65 Van Brode Milling Co., Inc., Clinton, Mass... Spork for Combination Plastic Spoon, Fork and Knife.</p>
                
                <h4>Yet a spork is so much more than just a poor excuse for an eating utensil.</h4>

                <p>A spork is a perfect metaphor for human existance. It tries to function as both spoon and fork, and because of this dual nature, it fails miserably at both. You cannot have soup with a spork, it is far too shallow; you cannot eat meat with a spork, the prongs are too small.</p>

                    <p>As we know, a spork is completely innapropriate as an eating utensil, so the question arises:  <cite>``But then, what can I use a spork for?''</cite></p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Pull out all but the edge prongs, rip off the handle, and stick it in your mouth. Instant Dracula!
                        <li>Invert the spork (turn it into a <a href="#foon">foon</a>) and load stuff into the depression and fire!
                        <li><a href="#foon">Foon</a> your spork and lay it on the table with the arch up, then press on the high arc and release. Flying Foons!

                            <a href="#foon">foon</a> in rapid sucession, the resulting <em>crack</em> sound is known as a ` <em>spack</em>'. This is hours of fun.
                        <li><a href="#foon">Foon</a> your spork and turn the prongs up, you have just created a <em>sporfoontapult</em>, perfect for launchings (see above).
                        <li>Alternately bend the prongs inward and outward and stand the spork on end. This is a <em>leaning tower of spork</em>. You can then launch
                            <a href="#foon">foons</a> over it.
                        <li>Get a bunch of friends together and make a plenty <a href="#foon">foons</a>. Then start launching them at each other, the objective is to collide foons in mid-air. Note: The more foons in the air the better, try to launch 5-10 at a time for a challenge.
                        <li>Plant them in your lawn to scare away burglers

                    <h4>What other people do with sporks.</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The band ``Soup'' threw out one thousand of them during shows.</li>
                        <li><a href="mailto:dkhelmet@voicenet.com">Dark Helmet</a> suggests the ``Spork War''. Much like pencil war, you try and crack one spork with the other. One player holds the spork horizontally, and the other holds it vertically, bends back the handle, lets go, and hits the midsection of the other spork as hard as possible. If you dont break the other spork, you switch off roles. I would recommend using thick sporks with this one.</li>
                        <li><a href="mailto:cd000554@interramp.com">Joseph D Mulholland</a>, remembers that way back in the fourth grade he and a bunch of pals played ``lowest spork number'', where you compare the number on the
                        back of the spork and the lowest wins. <em>Sadly, I remember doing
                        this as well.</em></li>
                        <li><a href="mailto:jbragg@erols.com">John Bragg</a> likes to
                        paint them gold and put them behind his ear, so he can be a ``Spork

                <li>Taco Bell, while their sporks only have three prongs and are unsuitable for fooning, they are nice and sturdy.

                Fried Chicken</a>, in some parts of the country, still gives out sporks. If I remember properly, They are quite tiny and flimsy, with four prongs.
                <li>Wendy's in upstate New York gives out sporks, and according to <a
                href="mailto:horseboy@netheaven.com">Peter Blackbird</a>, they are
                very easy to foon.
                <li>New York Public School's sporks are green and have four
                prongs. They are among the best I have ever used.
                <li>New Jersey Public School's sporks are white, four pronged, and
                quite thin, perfect for fooning, yet do not jump as high as as New
                York sporks.
                <li>In Central High School in Kansas City, Missouri, the sporks have
                three prongs and are quite tough to foon (<em>but it can be done, <a

                <li>In New Zealand, according to <a

                company named ``Lily''.

                located in front of the Chem/Biochem building.
                <li>According to <a href="mailto:bkeller@premier.net">Barbara
                Keller</a>, you can get silver sporks from a company called Dansk.
                <li>In the Pima County Adult Detention Center (located in lovely Tuscon

                <li>President Clinton used a spork as ``The symbol for this
                administration'', because of it's dual nature. What he neglected to
                mention was that it is impossible to eat with.

                <p>A foon is the inverse of the spork, and is created through a process
                known as <cite>fooning</cite>. The process can only be done on
                flexible sporks (Taco Bell sporks are right out, they crack as soon as
                you apply any kind of pressure) and it takes a skilled hand. Beware!
                You are apt to crack many sporks before you become a true master of

                <h4>The process of fooning is as follows:</h4>
                <ol>
                <li>Place your thumb on the bottom curve of the spork
                <li>Gently push in with the thumb until the spork is inverted
                <li>If done properly, you may let go and the spork will retain it's
                foon shape
                </ol>

                <p>Once you have your foon a whole new world of enjoyment between you and your spork/foon will open up for you.</p>
